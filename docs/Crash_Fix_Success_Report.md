## ✅ **What Was Fixed**

### **Before (Crashed):**
```
[37652:28068:1012/212513.711:FATAL:content\browser\renderer_host\render_frame_host_impl.cc:3624] 
Check failed: CanExecuteJavaScript().
```
- ❌ Fatal error dialog appeared
- ❌ Browser crashed completely
- ❌ Gmail navigation failed
- ❌ No functionality possible

### **After (Working):**
- ✅ **No fatal errors** - Browser runs smoothly
- ✅ **Successful Gmail navigation** - Page loads completely
- ✅ **Stable console** - Only normal network messages
- ✅ **No crashes** - Full functionality restored

---

## 🔧 **Technical Solution Applied**

### **Root Cause:**
JavaScript execution during restricted navigation states violated Chromium's security model.

### **Solution Implemented:**
1. **Complete JavaScript Elimination** - Removed all `SafeExecuteJavaScript()` calls
2. **Native UI Framework** - Implemented `PreviewManager` using `views::Widget`
3. **WebContentsObserver Integration** - Proper navigation timing
4. **Security Model Compliance** - Respects Chromium's architectural constraints

### **Code Changes:**
```cpp
// REMOVED (caused crashes):
SafeExecuteJavaScript(immediate_test);
CreateTestImageDisplay(); // Used JavaScript

// IMPLEMENTED (crash-free):
gfx::Image immediate_feedback = CreateSuccessImage();
preview_manager_.ShowPreview(immediate_feedback);
```
