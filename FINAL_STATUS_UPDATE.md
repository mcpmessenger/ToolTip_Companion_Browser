# Status Update - ToolTip Companion Browser

## Date: October 9, 2025
## Status: Working Toolbar Spider + Navigrab Preview (Next: per-element crawl)

---

## Highlights

- SpiderButton added to Chromium toolbar and visible in `out/Default` builds.
- Demo crawl flow: click Spider to start/stop; on stop we capture an image and show a hover preview.
- Navigrab wired: attempts memory capture (`CaptureToMemory`) and decodes PNG to show in preview; falls back to window snapshot if unavailable.
- Stable build and launch path documented; side-by-side error avoided by launching `out/Default/chrome.exe`.

## Whatâ€™s Implemented

- Toolbar integration and metadata for SpiderButton
- Demo crawl state (text updates) and short timer
- Navigrab-backed screenshot preview on hover
- Incremental build workflow (`autoninja -C out/Default chrome`)

## How to Launch

```powershell
& 'C:\chromium\src\src\out\Default\chrome.exe' --no-sandbox --disable-gpu --user-data-dir='C:\chromium\src\src\out\Default\UserData_SpiderTest'
```

## Next Steps

1. Element-by-element crawl: discover interactive elements, click them, capture per-element screenshots.
2. Map captured images to hover previews and show contextual info (URL/title).
3. Persistence: store thumbnails to disk and index for quick lookup.
4. Re-enable and polish DarkModeButton.

## Notes

- `initialexe\chrome.exe` may trigger side-by-side issues; prefer `out/Default\chrome.exe`.
- Close running custom Chromium windows before rebuilding to avoid linker file locks.

## Summary

We have a visible, working Spider control with a Navigrab-backed image preview. The next milestone is to wire real crawl behavior and per-element screenshot tooltips, then finalize a production-quality experience (persistence, styling, dark mode).
