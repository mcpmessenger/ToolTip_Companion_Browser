# Chromium C++ Integration Research Summary

## 1. Chromium Architecture Overview
Chromium employs a multi-process architecture, separating different functionalities into distinct processes (e.g., browser process, renderer process, GPU process). This design enhances stability, security, and performance. Our C++ library will need to interact with these processes, likely residing primarily within the browser process for core logic and potentially communicating with renderer processes for DOM interaction and screenshot capture.

## 2. C++ Integration Points

*   **Content API:** The Content API offers a set of C++ classes and methods for handling various browser tasks, including network requests, file I/O, and GPU rendering. This API will be essential for tasks like capturing screenshots and potentially interacting with the web page's content.

*   **Extension API:** For functionalities that resemble browser extensions, the C++ implementation often resides in `extensions/browser/api/myapi` or `chrome/browser/extensions/api/myapi`. While our tooltip system isn't a traditional extension, understanding this structure can guide our code placement within the Chromium source.

*   **Existing Codebase Analysis:** The provided `ToolTip_Companion_Browser` repository already contains `screenshot_capture.h/.cc` and `element_detector.h/.cc` files within `tooltip_components/chrome/browser/tooltip`. This suggests a pre-existing structure for integrating custom C++ logic into the Chromium browser. We should leverage this existing structure as much as possible.

## 3. Build System (GN/Ninja)
Chromium uses GN (Generate Ninja) to create Ninja build files. To integrate our new C++ library, we will need to modify the appropriate `BUILD.gn` files. This involves:

*   Defining new targets for our source files (e.g., `source_set` for a library).
*   Specifying dependencies on other Chromium modules.
*   Configuring include paths and other build flags.

## 4. Key Components Identified in Existing Codebase

*   **`screenshot_capture.h/.cc`**: These files appear to handle the logic for capturing screenshots of web elements. The `ScreenshotCapture` class inherits from `content::WebContentsObserver`, indicating its role in observing and interacting with web content.

*   **`element_detector.h/.cc`**: These files seem responsible for detecting interactive elements on a web page. The `ElementDetector` class also inherits from `content::WebContentsObserver` and uses JavaScript execution to find elements. It defines `kInteractiveTags` and `kInteractiveAttributes` which will be useful for our DOM crawling.

*   **`tooltip_browser_integration.h/.cc` and `tooltip_service.h/.cc`**: These files likely provide the higher-level integration points and service management for the tooltip functionality within the browser process. We will need to understand how these components interact to fully integrate our new features.

## Next Steps

Based on this research, the next phase will involve designing the C++ library architecture and API specification, taking into account the existing codebase structure and Chromium's integration patterns. We will focus on how to extend the `ScreenshotCapture` and `ElementDetector` functionalities to meet the project requirements, and how to manage the client-side storage and display of tooltips.
