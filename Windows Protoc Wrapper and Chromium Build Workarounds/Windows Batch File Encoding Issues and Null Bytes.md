## Windows Batch File Encoding Issues and Null Bytes

The `SyntaxError: source code cannot contain null bytes` often arises on Windows when batch files, particularly those generated by other processes like Python or PowerShell, are inadvertently saved with UTF-16LE encoding. This encoding uses two bytes per character, with many characters having a null byte (`0x00`) as their second byte. When the Windows command processor (`cmd.exe`) encounters a null byte, it interprets it as an End-Of-File (EOF) marker, leading to truncated execution and errors [1].

**Key Observations:**

*   **UTF-16LE Encoding:** Batch files saved in UTF-16LE format with a Byte Order Mark (BOM) are a common cause. The BOM itself can be misinterpreted, and the subsequent null bytes in character encoding cause the command processor to stop reading the file prematurely [1].
*   **Python/PowerShell Interaction:** When Python or PowerShell scripts generate batch files, they might default to UTF-16LE encoding, especially when piping output to a file, which can introduce these null bytes [2].
*   **`@` Character Issue:** A specific example cited is the `@` character in UTF-16LE being encoded as `@` followed by a null byte, causing the batch file to stop after the first character [1].

**Solutions and Workarounds:**

1.  **Save as ANSI or UTF-8 without BOM:** The most direct solution is to ensure the batch file is saved with ANSI encoding or UTF-8 without a Byte Order Mark (BOM). Many text editors allow specifying the encoding upon saving. If a script is generating the batch file, ensure it explicitly writes in ANSI or UTF-8 without BOM [1, 3].
    *   **Python Example:** When writing files in Python, specify the encoding:
        ```python
        with open('script.bat', 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as f:
            f.write('@echo off\n')
            f.write('echo Hello, world.\n')
        ```
        Or for ANSI (Windows-1252):
        ```python
        with open('script.bat', 'w', encoding='windows-1252', newline='') as f:
            f.write('@echo off\n')
            f.write('echo Hello, world.\n')
        ```
2.  **Convert Existing Files:** If a batch file is already corrupted, it can be converted. Command-line tools or text editors can be used to change the encoding. For example, piping a UTF-16LE file to an ANSI file can remove null bytes [4].
3.  **PowerShell Encoding:** When using PowerShell to generate files, explicitly set the encoding to UTF-8 without BOM using the `-Encoding UTF8NoBOM` parameter for cmdlets like `Out-File` or `Set-Content` [5].
4.  **`chcp 65001`:** While not a direct fix for the file encoding, setting the console codepage to UTF-8 (`chcp 65001`) can help `cmd.exe` interpret UTF-8 encoded files correctly. However, this might not resolve issues with UTF-16LE files containing null bytes [1].

By ensuring `protoc-gen-ts_proto.bat` is correctly encoded (preferably UTF-8 without BOM or ANSI), the `SyntaxError: source code cannot contain null bytes` should be resolved, allowing the Chromium build process to proceed without this specific batch file corruption issue.
